During that time, I learned how to work with R and RStudio.\nMore Importantly, I gained an understanding of how to extract meaningful insights from data, and tell compelling stories using plots (ggplot in R), and statistical models. I also acquired skills in using other resources, such as Github, to keep my code organized and collaborate with others.\nThis course also covered the fundamentals of coding and statistics while providing me with the opportunity to experience what it’s like to take a Harvard course."

Its goal is to enable students to develop an engineering mindset and foster teamwork while designing, building, and programming robots to compete in alliance formats against other teams.\nAnd In the week leading up to the tournament, my teammates and I dedicated our after-school time to practicing and improving our robot’s structure and coding."

Throughout this process, teams were allowed to practice before the tournament and showcase their ready-to-go robots. During those few hours, we practiced with other teams, continuously improving and modifying our robot’s strength and accuracy as we went along. Noting tips and tricks given to us from other teams as well as sharing our knowledge and analysis on other teams robot.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Here is closer look at our robot"

He acknowledged the collective effort and determination of all participants in the program and encouraged us to continue contributing towards its development.\nAfter hearing that speech, my teammates and I no longer felt nervous and shy. Instead, we became excited and intrigued when we saw other really cool and impressive robots throughout the competition.\nAs the tournament continued, despite losing many matches and winning only a few, we persevered and never gave up. We learned from our mistakes and made the most of the little time we had to brainstorm and improve our robot once again.\n\n\n\nPhoto: A dashboard displaying our progess (we were the blue side)"

I felt a bit sad and disappointed of course but at the same time I also felt proud and excited to have gone though every match and obstacles with my teammates. A “win win” as our adult mentor said to us. And with that, I returned home eager to engage in discussions with my family about the experience. And greatly enthused to collaborate with my teammates to explore ways for enhancement, potential victories, and improved performance in the upcoming year.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Our team slogan"
