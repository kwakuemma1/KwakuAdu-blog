    "text": "A Noted Discovery\nIn the course I learned how mathematics is used to make this process possible and user-friendly. I improved my visual understanding of Geometry due to Blender’s practical use of the 3D coordinate system to manipulate and design objects. The 3D coordinate system in Blender works like a virtual 3D space, where every point in a scene is defined by three numbers (X, Y, and Z).\nThese numbers represent the object’s position relative to the world or to other objects in the scene. By using these coordinates, Blender can precisely position objects in the 3D space, allowing one to move, rotate, and scale them with accuracy."

    "section": "My Journey Through Creating the Apple Bowl Scene.",
    "text": "My Journey Through Creating the Apple Bowl Scene.\nBy the end of the course, I created a 3D representation of an apple bowl, in the bowl are apples resting on a cloth. Adjacent to the bowl, is a designed knife placed upon the same cloth that rests on the wooden floor after cutting a washed apple in half. Below is my reflection of each lesson:\n\n\n\nPhoto: A rendered picture of the final look\n\n\n\nLesson One: Creating the Apple\nTo make the 3D apple, my first step involved crafting a solid 3D version of it, commonly referred to as an Organic Model in Blender. Making the organic model was a very cool experience for me. I was introduced to using new tools such as sculpting to mold, shape, and fine-tune digital clay-like materials directly on the 3D surface. The fine-tuning required smoothing out the meshes (vertices and edges) of the sculptured images.\nOnce done, I then proceeded to apply textures to wrap it around the organic model to resemble a real-life apple. The process of adding the textures was also a really fascinating experience for me, as I was once again introduced to new tools, such as Texture Painting to paint directly onto the model’s surface to add color and details, UV Mapping to apply textures and images accurately to the apple, and Principled Shader to control various surface properties of objects, such as color, roughness, and transparency,\n\n\n\nPhoto: A picture of an apple’s texture (I used this in the process of making the apples looks more realsitc)\n\n\nTo enhance the level of details on the outside and inside of the apple, I used the following textures below:\n\n\n\nPhoto: A picture of an apple’s texture from different views\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: A picutre of a cutted apple in half.\n\n\nFinally, after replicating the apples, I proceeded to add a leaf to a couple of them using the image shown below, which has a transparent alpha channel. A special type of image that allows certain parts of the picture to be see-through or invisible.\n\n\n\nPhoto: An apple leaf\n\n\n\n\nLesson Two: Simulating the Cloth\nThe next step in the creation of the final product, was to make the cloth. After making the cloth, I was then introduced to the process of using and learning how to perform a cloth simulation. Which was used to lay the cloth midway in the bowl and then onto the ground. This process not only taught me how to make and use a cloth simulation it also introduced me to other tools when making simulations including, the Fluid Simulation to animate liquids, such as water, pouring, splashing, and interacting with objects and (one of my favorite) the Particle System to create simulations for various effects like smoke, fire, rain, dust, and more.\n\n\n\nPhoto: The texture used to make the cloth\n\n\n\n\nLesson Three: Crafting the knife\nThe third step in the creation of the final product, was making the knife. Throughout this process, I used the same technique I used for making the apples, starting with creating the organic model, and then applying the textures and materials. However, this time, I had more detail to work with to make the knife look as realistic as possible.\nBelow are the following textures I worked with:\n\n\n\nPhoto: A picture of a knife texture from different sides\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: A picture of a knife texture from different views\n\n\n\n\nLesson Four: The bowl and Wooden Floor\nThe final step involved creating the bowl and Wooden Floor. As with the previous steps, I used the same technique used for making the apples, beginning with making the organic model, and then applying the textures and materials.\nHowever, upon completing the bowl, I took a moment to explore the possibility of making it spin. Through some exploration, I discovered that blender’s timeline could be used to manage animations and edit keyframes. With this newfound discovery, I was able to animated the bowl, making it spin in different directions!\n\n\n\nPhoto: The texture used for the wood"

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nTo help preserve endangered languages, policy makers must introduce policies that make endangered regions more attractive to prevent migration of current speakers to urban regions.\nAlso improving literacy rate and agricultural economic opportunities in these regions could help preserve the local population, and in turn preserve the local language.\nLanguages that are already classified as definitely endangered are at significant risk of going extinct. Urgent attention should be given to such languages."

Throughout this process, teams were allowed to practice before the tournament and showcase their ready-to-go robots. During those few hours, we practiced with other teams, continuously improving and modifying our robot’s strength and accuracy as we went along. Noting tips and tricks given to us from other teams as well as sharing our knowledge and analysis on other teams robot.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Here is closer look at our robot"

He acknowledged the collective effort and determination of all participants in the program and encouraged us to continue contributing towards its development.\nAfter hearing that speech, my teammates and I no longer felt nervous and shy. Instead, we became excited and intrigued when we saw other really cool and impressive robots throughout the competition.\nAs the tournament continued, despite losing many matches and winning only a few, we persevered and never gave up. We learned from our mistakes and made the most of the little time we had to brainstorm and improve our robot once again.\n\n\n\nPhoto: A dashboard displaying our progess (we were the blue side)"

I felt a bit sad and disappointed of course but at the same time I also felt proud and excited to have gone though every match and obstacles with my teammates. A “win win” as our adult mentor said to us. And with that, I returned home eager to engage in discussions with my family about the experience. And greatly enthused to collaborate with my teammates to explore ways for enhancement, potential victories, and improved performance in the upcoming year.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Our team slogan"
