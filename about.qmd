Hi! I go by **Emmanuel Yeboah** or my native name **Kwaku Adu**. I'm a rising junior in High School. I love Geography and history. I am currently exploring robotics, film making and animation, and computer programming. I like to play badminton or tennis when free.  

With this blog, I plan to document some cool things I am learning and some life experiences.

You can reach  me at : `emmayeboah` the year `2007` at `gmail.com`
