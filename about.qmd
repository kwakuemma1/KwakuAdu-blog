Hi! I go by **Emmanuel Yeboah** or my native name **Kwaku Adu**. I enjoy graphic-designing, film-making, and playing badminton and  tennis. 

With this blog, I plan to document some cool things I am learning and some life experiences.

You can reach  me at : `emmayeboah` the year `2007` at `gmail.com`
