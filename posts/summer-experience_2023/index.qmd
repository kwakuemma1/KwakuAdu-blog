## My Experience 
From June 4th to July 12, 2023, I spent my summer learning the basics of data science at [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/). During that time, I learned how to work with R and RStudio. 

More Importantly, I gained an understanding of how to extract meaningful insights from data, and tell compelling stories using plots (ggplot in R), and statistical models. I also acquired skills in using other resources, such as Github, to keep my code organized and collaborate with others.

This course also covered the fundamentals of coding and statistics while providing me with the opportunity to experience what it's like to take a Harvard course. 

## My Final Project
By the end of the course (as a final project) I successfully created a mini-website showcasing my analysis on [Endangered Languages](https://kwakuemma1.github.io/KwakuAduBlog/Endangered-Languages/). The topic delves into the social and economic factors endangering vulnerably languages.
