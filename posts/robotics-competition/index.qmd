## A week before the tournament

On January 29, 2022, during my freshmen year in high school, I had my very first robotics competition. And a week before the tournament my teammates and I prepared and practiced before the competition.  

## A few hours before the tournament

I would admit during the admissions and welcoming process before the competition I was nervous and a bit shy and so were some of my teammates. During the process, teams where allowed to practice before the tournament and get a chance to show off their ready to go robots.

## During the Tournament
In the course of the tournament my teammates and I no longer felt nervous and shy but rather excited and intrigued to see other really cool and impressive robots. And as the tournament continued although we kept losing allot of matches and wining very few we still persisted and never gave up. Learning from our mistakes and taking what little time we have to brainstorm and improve our robot.

## At the end of the Tounrnament

We lost. Ranking second to last out of every other team. I felt a bit sad and disappointed of course but at the same time I also felt proud and excited to have gone though every match and obstacles with my teammates. A "win win" as our adult mentor said to us. And with that, I returned home eager to engage in discussions with my family about the experience. Furthermore, I was greatly enthused to collaborate with my teammates to explore ways for enhancement, potential victories, and improved performance in the upcoming year.
