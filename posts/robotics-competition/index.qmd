## A week before the tournament

On January 29, 2022 during my freshmen year in high school I had my very first robotics competition. And a week before the tournament my teammates and I prepared and practiced before the competition.  

## A few hours before the tournament

I would admit during the whole admissions and welcoming process before the competition I was nervous and a bit shy and so did my teams. during the admissions and welcoming process teams where allowed to practice before the tournament and get a chance to show off their ready to go robot.
