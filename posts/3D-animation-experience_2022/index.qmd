## My Reflection

From October 1st to November 30th, I spent my winter breaks learning the basics of creating 3D animation in [CGBOOST Academy](https://academy.cgboost.com/courses). Throughout that time, I learned how to work with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/about/).

Foremost, I gained an understanding of how to create a 3D object from scratch and using lighting as well as designing to make the 3D object look the way one would it to look like. I also acquired skills in using 2d Images in the process of making 3D objects. 



## My Journey Through Creating the Apple Bowl. 
By the end of the course I successfully created a 3D apple bowl and a knife on a wooden floor. But doing so was not an easy task. Here is my reflection of each lesson:

### Lesson One: Creating the Apple

To first make the 3D apple I had to first make a solid 3D version of it or in Blender terms an Organic Model

## My Journey Through Creating the Dount. 
To continue my exploration into further understanding of the world of 3D animation I found a youtube playlist of a step by step intruction on how to make a donut.
