## My Experince 
On June 4th to July 12 2023, I spent my summer learning basics of data science at [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp.](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/) During that time I learnt how to work with R and Rstudio. as well also understand why and how to plot interactive, non interactive, and many other types of plots from scratch. 

In addition, I also learnt how to use other resources such as Github to keep your code organized and collaborative. This course also taught me the basics of coding and statistics as well as giving me the chance to experience what it's like  taking a Harvard course.  

## My Final Project
By the end of the course (as a final project) I was able create a mini website that shows my analysis on [Endangered Languages](https://ema-pubweb0707.quarto.pub/kanes_ds-class_degree-of-endangered-languages/) 
A topic that dives into the Social and Economic Factors Endangering vulnerably languages.
